'''
We start by picking a random route.
Pick a neighboring route as a new candidate.
One way to do this is to randomly pick two cities on our original route and reverse a path between them.
If a candidate route is better, select it as a new current route.
If a candidate route is worse, select it as a new current route with a low probability.
The higher the temperature is the higher the chance of selecting the worse route.
Repeat from step two, until stoppage criteria.
