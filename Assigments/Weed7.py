# Example usage:
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The lazy dog barks back. A brown cat sleeps on the windowsill. The quick cat meows loudly. Birds chirp in the morning, and the sun rises above the horizon. People gather in the park for a picnic. Kids play games, and families enjoy the sunny day. As the day progresses, clouds gather, and rain starts to fall. Everyone rushes to find shelter. After the rain, a rainbow appears in the sky, bringing smiles to the faces of those who stayed. The day ends with a beautiful sunset, and the moon and stars light up the night sky."
